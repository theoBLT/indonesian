### Why learn Indonesian, out of all languages?

My wife is Indonesian! Learning her language has all kinds of benefits: 
* Language is the psychology of a culture. Learning the language lets me deeply understand her culture. 
* Indonesians aren't forced to switch languages when I'm around (In-laws, wife's friends, etc.)
* When/if I have children, I'll never be cut out of a conversation with my own child
* My wife and I can use our secret language in negotiation or public situations


### Why record all the words you learn this way?

I don't remember what I don't write, and am a very visual person. This site is a forcing function to remember what I've learned. 


### But really, why?

I love tinckering with technology. This website is a great excuse to improve my coding skills. I've already learned so much just spinning up the front page!
