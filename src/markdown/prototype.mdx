import {Phrase} from "../components/article-bits/phrase";

So here's our attempt at syntax coloring: 

<Phrase 
    original="Kok brani sih ampe pinjem duit ke orangtuanya gitu?"
    translation="How come she's bold enough to borrow money from her parents?"
     mapping={[
        ["Kok","discourse_particle",""],
        ["brani","adjective","dare","berani"],
        ["sih","discourse_particle",""],
        ["ampe","adverb","until",""],
        ["pinjem","verb","borrow"],
        ["duit","noun","money"],
        ["ke","preposition","to"],
        ["orangtuanya","possessive","her parents"],
        ["gitu","adverb","thus"],
        ["?","punctuation",""]
        ]}
   />

What we've done above is highlight with different colors the different components of a sentence. 

What I'll want to do next is to:
* Then, to make all this _really_ powerful, I will link the words inside the sentences to individual words, first by adding a link to the slug if it exists. 
* Finally, I could also use that same `Phrase` component inside my `definitions`! That way people can use the example sentences for my definitions as a way of navigating and learning new words.
