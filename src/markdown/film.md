Today Iâ€™d like to talk about Indonesian movies â€” in particular those that have been most helpful to me in learning **conversational** Indonesian. 

I recommend you watch them using **Indonesian** subtitles.[^1] On to the list! 

### 1 - Love for sale (2008)

An extraordinary movie. The main character is a single man hopeless to get a girlfriend. One day, he discovers a mobile app offering long-term girlfriend "rental services". Tinder, except love is guaranteedÂ®. 

The girlfriend appears the next day and becomes an essential part of his family and work life. 


Check it out on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172996/) or [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81016338) - and if you liked the first one, Check out Love for Sale 2! ([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10643938/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81231382)).



### 2 - Cek Toko Sebelah (2016)

As he nears retirement, the main character hopes his son can take over the family Warung. The son doesn't see it this way â€” his definition of success is a corner office at a multinational company. 

This film ([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6366854/)) is a great story of the conflict between family tradition and modern ambitions. A great father-son love story, too. It's **not** on Netflix so get ready for a good dose of googling through dodgy streaming sites! 

### 3 - Quickie Express (2007)

Jojo, a young man from Jakarta ends up working as Escort guy. I haven't watched this one yet but heard it was great comedy, so it made the list! 

Also not on Netflix, sorry! 


That's all folks for a first short list of Indonesian movies. If you have anymore recommendations, hit me up on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/celotehbahasa)! 

Bonus tip: [click here](https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/2867320) to view **all of the movies** in the "Indonesian movies" category on Netflix. Handy. 


[^1]:	[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927148/) prove that watching movies with foreign language subtitles is more effective to retain the language (albeit _less_ effective to retain the plot -but thatâ€™s not our goal, is it? ðŸ˜‡ )
