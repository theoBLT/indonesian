I've been struggling to remember Indonesian days of the week for months now.
I tried to listen to [THE song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQVG53eU2gE), but even that didn't help: the word for "days" were too far from the base languages I know.

That's until I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/), which made it all clearer.

So, sunday is **Minggu**, which [comes from](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minggu) the Portuguese word <Pronounce text="Domingo" language="	pt-pt" />, which in old Melayu became _Dominggu_, then became simply _Minggu_ at the turn of the 20th Century. Easy, right?

From there, the next four days of the week are pulled from Arabic **numbers**. That's because in Arabic, to say "Monday", you literally say "Day 2", Tuesday is "Day 3", and so on for Wednesday and Thursday. Check out how close each Arabic number resembles the day of the week in Indonesian!

| Day       | Day (Indonesian) | Day (Arabic)                                   | Number (Arabic)                                      |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Monday    | Senin            | <Pronounce text="الإثنين" language="ar-sa" />  | Two - <Pronounce text="اثنين" language="ar-sa" />    |
| Tuesday   | Selasa           | <Pronounce text="الثلاثاء" language="ar-sa" /> | Three - <Pronounce text="ثلاثة " language="ar-sa" /> |
| Wednesday | Rabu             | <Pronounce text="الأربعاء" language="ar-sa" /> | Four - <Pronounce text="أربعة" language="ar-sa" />   |
| Thursday  | Kamis            | <Pronounce text="الخميس" language="ar-sa" />   | Five - <Pronounce text="خمسة " language="ar-sa" />   |

Friday (Jumat) and Saturday (Sabtu) also come from the equivalent arabic words, <Pronounce text="الجمعه" language="ar-sa" /> and <Pronounce text="السبت" language="ar-sa" /> respectively. (However, those words in arabic [do not refer to numbers](https://blogs.transparent.com/arabic/where-do-the-arabic-names-of-weekdays-come-from/)).

So now we know: days in Indonesian are named after Arabic numbers/days, and Portuguese. I'm curious to know how people described days in Melayu before the Arabs arrived in Indonesia in the 13th century.

Also, why did Sunday get replaced? It used to be called Ahad (from <Pronounce text="الأحد" language="ar-sa" />), and apparently it still is called that way [in Malay](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/h2nqjo6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [and some Indonesians](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/h2mvfvp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but for most people it got replaced by a Portuguese word, 3 centuries later. Why? If you know the answer, [hit me up](https://twitter.com/celotehbahasa)!
