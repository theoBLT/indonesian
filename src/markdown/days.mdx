I've been struggling to remember Indonesian days of the week for months now.
I tried to listen to [THE song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQVG53eU2gE), but even that didn't help: the word for "days" were too far from the base languages I know.

That's until I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/), explaining the origin of the days of the week.

- Sunday is **Minggu**, which [comes from](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minggu) the Portuguese word `Domingo`, which in old Melayu became _Dominggu_, then became simply _Minggu_ at the turn of the 20th Century. Easy, right?

From there, all other days of the week are pulled from Arabic:

- Monday: **Senin** comes from the _arabic_ word <Pronounce text="الإثنين" language="ar-sa" />, pronounced _A lith **nayn**_ — quite close to "al senin"
- Tuesday: **Selasa** comes from the _arabic_ word <Pronounce text="الثلاثاء" language="ar-sa" /> which is pronounced _Ath **thu la tha**’_
- Wednesday: **Rabu** comes from the _arabic_ word <Pronounce text="الأربعاء" language="ar-sa" /> which is pronounced _Al **ar ba a**’_
- Thursday: **Kamis** comes from the _arabic_ word <Pronounce text="الخميس" language="ar-sa" /> which is pronounced _Al **kha mis**_
- Friday: **Jumat** comes from the _arabic_ word <Pronounce text="الجمعه" language="ar-sa" /> which is pronounced _Al **jum ah**_
- Saturday: **Sabtu** comes from the _arabic_ word <Pronounce text="السبت" language="ar-sa" /> which is pronounced _As **sabt**_

I'm curious to know how people described days in Melayu, before the Arabs arrived in Indonesia in the 13th century.

Also, why did Sunday get replaced? It used to be called Ahad (from the arabic الأحد or _Al **‘ahad**_), and apparently it still is called that way [in Malay](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/h2nqjo6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [and some Indonesians](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/h2mvfvp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but for most people it got replaced by a Portuguese word, 3 centuries later. Why? If you know the answer, [hit me up](https://twitter.com/celotehbahasa)!
