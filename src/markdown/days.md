I've been struggling to remember Indonesian days of the week for months now.
I tried to listen to [THE song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQVG53eU2gE), but even that didn't help: the word for "days" were too far from the base languages I know.

That's until I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/o5j3rd/senin_selasa_rabu_kamis_jumat_sabtu_minggu_itu/), explaining the origin of the days of the week.

- Sunday is **Minggu**, which [comes from](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minggu) the Portuguese word `Domingo`, which in old Melayu became _Dominggu_, then became simply _Minggu_ at the turn of the 20th Century

From there, days of the week are pulled from Arabic:

- Monday: **Senin** comes from the _arabic_ word الإثنين which [is pronounced](https://forvo.com/word/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%AB%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%86/) _A lith **nayn**_ — quite close to "al senin"
- Tuesday: **Selasa** comes from the _arabic_ word الثلاثاء which is pronounced _Ath **thu la tha**’_
- Wednesday: **Rabu** comes from the _arabic_ word الأربعاء which is pronounced _Al **ar ba a**’_
- Thursday: **Kamis** comes from the _arabic_ word الخميس which is pronounced _Al **kha mis**_
- Friday: **Jumat** comes from the _arabic_ word الجمعه which is pronounced _Al **jum ah**_
- Saturday: **Sabtu** comes from the _arabic_ word السبت which is pronounced _As **sabt**_

It makes me very curious to know how days were described in Melayu, before the Arabs arrived in Indonesia in the 13th century and why Sunday, which used to —logically— be called Ahad (from the arabic الأحد or _Al **‘ahad**_), was changed to a Portugues word, 3 centuries later.
