# Imbuhans

Affixes are the most complex part of the Indonesian language, and also the most powerful.They let you take a word, and completely change its meaning in a predictable way.

We have those in English, too - take the word "eat", for example. Let's play with it, and find a few variations: 
* Eat`er` → *the person* who eats
* Eat`-ery` → *the place* where you eat
* Eat`-eable` →  can be eaten

Indonesian take this concept, and stretch it beyond your wildest dreams. Let's take `makan` which coincidently also means "to eat". Here are some variations:

* `Pe`makan (eater) → the person who eats
* Makan`an` (food) → the thing you eat
* `Me`makan`kan`(to feed) → the act of making someone eat
* `Pe`makan`kan` (ingestion) → the _process_ of eating
* `Ke`makan (accidently eating something) → inadvertent eating 
* `Me`makan (consume) → the result of eating

To be continued!
