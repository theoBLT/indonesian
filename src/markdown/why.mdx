My wife is Indonesian! Learning her language has all kinds of benefits:

- Language is the psychology of a culture. Learning the language lets me deeply understand the Indonesian culture.
- Indonesians aren't forced to switch languages when I'm around (In-laws, wife's friends, etc.)
- When/if we have children, I'll never be cut out of a conversation with our child
- Bonus: we have a secret language we can use in negotiation or public situations

### Why record all the words you learn this way?

I don't remember what I don't write, and am a very visual person. This site is a forcing function to remember what I've learned.

### But really, why?

I love tinkering with technology. This website is a great excuse to improve my coding skills. I've already learned so much just spinning up the front page!
