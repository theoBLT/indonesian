[Thanks to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesian/comments/odgmy8/more_info_jakarta_dialect/), I found this Amazing book: [Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian](https://www.amazon.com/Colloquial-Jakartan-Indonesian-Pacific-Linguistics/dp/0858835711), by [James Sneddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sneddon).

In it, the Author deconstructs quoloquial Indonesian this way:

Beyond correct translations into English, Sneddon also helps you understand how to parse each word, highlighting posessives, different verb forms, etc. I found his technique so useful to parse a sentence that I re-built a prototype of what he did below (hover on "kok" and "pijem" and click):

<iframe
  style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"

Next, I'll make a "code" version of that figma prototype, and make it easy for folks to explore colloquial Indonesian text that's new to them. Very excited about that!
