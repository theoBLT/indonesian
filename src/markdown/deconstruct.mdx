I found this Amazing book [via Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesian/comments/odgmy8/more_info_jakarta_dialect/): [Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian](https://www.amazon.com/Colloquial-Jakartan-Indonesian-Pacific-Linguistics/dp/0858835711), by [James Sneddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sneddon).

In it, the Author deconstructs quoloquial Indonesian this way:

Beyond correct translations into English, Sneddon also helps you understand how to parse each word, highlighting posessives, different verb forms, etc. I found his technique so useful to parse a sentence that I re-built a prototype of what he did below (hover on "kok" and "pijem" and click):

For fun, below, I translated this way of deconstructing sentences into actual code: 

<Phrase 
    original="Kok brani sih ampe pinjem duit ke orangtuanya gitu?"
    translation="How come she's bold enough to borrow money from her parents?"
     mapping={[
        ["Kok","discourse_particle",""],
        ["brani","adjective","dare","berani"],
        ["sih","discourse_particle",""],
        ["ampe","adverb","until",""],
        ["pinjem","verb","borrow"],
        ["duit","noun","money"],
        ["ke","preposition","to"],
        ["orangtuanya","possessive","her parents"],
        ["gitu","adverb","thus"],
        ["?","punctuation",""]
        ]}
   />

Highlight any word above, and you'll see their definition. For words that I already have in my database such as `berani`, you can even jump to a more complete definition. 
This is going to make it fun to deconstruct colloquial Indonesian down to its individual components. Exciting!
