This site is the place where I display the words I learn in Indonesian.
Check it out at [celotehbahsa.com](https://celotehbahsa.com).

Note to self: I was forced to set an environment variable of `NODE_VERSION=12` in order to deploy to Netlify with Gatsby 3 ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66880068/gatsby-3-x-netlify ): will have to be removed eventually as node versions need to move on.
